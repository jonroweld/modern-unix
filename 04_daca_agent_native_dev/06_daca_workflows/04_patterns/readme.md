# 04: [Common Dapr Workflow Patterns](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-patterns/)

Dapr Workflows can implement various standard orchestration patterns. This section explores common patterns and provides examples of how to realize them using Dapr Workflows.

For this step the `01_hello_workflow` code completed is our starter code. We will take it and implement each pattern.

**Key Topics:**
*   Sequential Execution (Chaining)
*   Parallel Execution (Fan-out/Fan-in)
*   Conditional Logic
*   Loops and Iterations
*   Human Interaction / External Event Pattern
*   Async HTTP APIs with workflows
