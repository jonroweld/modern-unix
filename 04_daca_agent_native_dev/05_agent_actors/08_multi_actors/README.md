# Step 5: Multi-Agent System with Dapr Actors

This is the fifth step of building AI Agents as Dapr Virtual Actors in the Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent (DACA) design pattern. In this step, you’ll create a scalable multi-agent system with a base Agent class, ChatActor, and MemoryActor, featuring a `TriageAgent`, `PanaCloudAgent`, `AgenticAIExpert`, `SalesExpert`, and `MemoryAgent`. You’ll learn abstraction, multi-agent coordination, AI integration, and cloud-native deployment with Kubernetes, building on actor-to-actor communication.
