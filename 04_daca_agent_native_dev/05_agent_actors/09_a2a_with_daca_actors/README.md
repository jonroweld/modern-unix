# A2A Integration with Dapr Actors
**Objective**: Integrate Google’s A2A protocol with Dapr Virtual Actors to enable interoperable agent communication across frameworks.

**Key Concepts**:
- A2A protocol: Standardized agent-to-agent communication (HTTP, JSON-RPC, SSE).[](https://www.maginative.com/article/google-just-launched-agent2agent-an-open-protocol-for-ai-agents-to-work-directly-with-each-other/)
- A2A Agent Cards: Advertising agent capabilities.[](https://www.stanventures.com/news/google-launches-agent2agent-protocol-to-unify-ai-agents-communication-2421/)
- Dapr-A2A synergy: Combining Dapr’s stateful actors with A2A’s communication layer.
- Interoperability: Connecting Dapr actors with external A2A-compliant agents.

**Learning Activities**:
- Study the A2A protocol specification and sample agents (e.g., from A2A GitHub).[](https://medium.com/google-cloud/getting-started-with-google-a2a-a-hands-on-tutorial-for-the-agent2agent-protocol-3d3b5e055127)
- Extend `ChatActor` to advertise its capabilities via an A2A Agent Card (JSON-based).
- Implement an A2A-compatible endpoint in `ChatActor` to handle tasks from external agents (e.g., a Google ADK agent).
- Connect `ChatActor` to a sample A2A agent (e.g., a currency converter) using HTTP/JSON-RPC.
- Use Dapr pub/sub to publish A2A task updates, ensuring compatibility with DACA’s event-driven model.
- Simulate a multi-agent workflow where a Dapr `ChatActor` collaborates with an external A2A agent to process a user request (e.g., answering a query with external data).

**Validation**:
- Send a request to `ChatActor` and verify it coordinates with the external A2A agent, returning a combined response.
- Check pub/sub logs for task updates and confirm the Agent Card is discoverable.
- Test interoperability with a different framework’s agent (e.g., LangGraph).
