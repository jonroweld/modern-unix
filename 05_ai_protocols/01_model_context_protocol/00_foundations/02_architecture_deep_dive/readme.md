# MCP Architecture Deep Dive

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is built upon a flexible client-server architecture designed to facilitate standardized communication between AI applications and various data sources or tools. Understanding these components is key to leveraging MCP effectively.

## Core Architectural Components

### 1. MCP Hosts

- **Definition:** MCP Hosts are applications that initiate the need to access external data or tools. They are the primary interface for the end-user or the AI model itself.
- **Examples:**
  - AI Assistants (e.g., Claude Desktop)
  - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) with AI capabilities (e.g., Zed, Sourcegraph Cody)
  - Custom AI-powered applications or workflows.
- **Role:** The Host discovers and manages connections to MCP Servers (often via an embedded or associated MCP Client). It translates user/model intent into requests that can be fulfilled by MCP Servers.

### 2. MCP Clients

- **Definition:** MCP Clients are protocol clients that act as intermediaries, maintaining one-to-one connections with MCP Servers. A single MCP Host can manage multiple MCP Clients, each connected to a different MCP Server.
- **Role:**
  - Establishes and manages the communication session with an MCP Server.
  - Handles the specifics of the MCP protocol (e.g., message formatting, capability negotiation).
  - Forwards requests from the Host to the Server and responses from the Server back to the Host.
  - Can be embedded within the Host application or run as a separate process.
- **Key Interaction:** The Client is responsible for the actual protocol-level communication.

### 3. MCP Servers

- **Definition:** MCP Servers are lightweight programs (processes) that expose specific capabilities (tools, resources, prompt templates) from a particular data source or service.
- **Examples:**
  - A server for accessing a local file system.
  - A server for interacting with the GitHub API.
  - A server for querying a Postgres database.
  - A server providing weather information.
- **Role:**
  - Connects directly to a data source or tool.
  - Implements the MCP protocol to respond to requests from an MCP Client.
  - Advertises its available tools, resources, and prompt templates to connected Clients.
- **Deployment:** Can run locally as a subprocess managed by the Host/Client (stdio server) or remotely, accessible via a URL (HTTP/SSE server, now evolving to streamable HTTP).

## Communication Backbone

### The Role of JSON-RPC 2.0

- **Standardization:** All messages exchanged between MCP Clients and Servers **MUST** adhere to the [JSON-RPC 2.0 specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).
- **Message Types:** This defines three fundamental message types:
  - **Requests:** Sent to initiate an operation (e.g., call a tool, get a resource). Must include an `id` and `method`.
  - **Responses:** Sent in reply to requests. Must include the same `id`. Can be a successful `result` or an `error` (with `code` and `message`).
  - **Notifications:** One-way messages with no reply expected (e.g., a server notifying a client about a resource update). Must not include an `id`.
- **Benefits:** JSON-RPC is lightweight, human-readable (as it's JSON), and widely supported, making it a good choice for a standardized protocol.

## Communication Models

### 1. Local Communication (Stdio Servers)

- **Mechanism:** The MCP Server runs as a subprocess of the Host/Client application. Communication typically occurs over standard input/output (stdin/stdout) pipes.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Simplicity:** Easier to set up for local tools or data.
  - **Security:** Data often doesn't leave the user's machine, enhancing privacy for local resources.
  - **Lifecycle Management:** The Host/Client often manages the lifecycle (start/stop) of the stdio server.
- **Use Cases:** Accessing local files, interacting with local databases, running local scripts as tools.

### 2. Remote Communication (HTTP Servers)

- **Mechanism:** The MCP Server runs as an independent process, potentially on a different machine, and is accessible via a URL. The communication typically uses HTTP(S). The MCP spec is evolving from HTTP+SSE to a more general "streamable HTTP" transport.
- **Characteristics:**
  - **Scalability:** Remote servers can be scaled independently.
  - **Accessibility:** Can provide access to cloud services, web APIs, or shared resources.
  - **Complexity:** May involve more setup regarding networking, security (HTTPS, authentication), and discovery.
- **Use Cases:** Connecting to web APIs (e.g., Google Drive, Slack), accessing shared databases, providing enterprise-wide toolsets.

## Client-Server Interaction Patterns (High-Level)

1.  **Initialization & Capability Negotiation:**
    - Client connects to Server.
    - They exchange capabilities to agree on what features will be used during the session (e.g., what tools the server offers, whether the client can handle server-initiated requests like sampling). This is a crucial first step.
2.  **Client-Initiated Requests:**
    - Host (via Client) requests a list of available tools/resources from the Server.
    - Host (via Client) invokes a specific tool on the Server with arguments.
    - Server processes the request and sends a response (result or error) back to the Client, which forwards it to the Host.
3.  **Server-Initiated Interactions (if supported and negotiated):**
    - **Resource Subscriptions & Notifications:** Client subscribes to a resource on the Server. Server sends asynchronous notifications to the Client when the resource changes.
    - **Sampling Requests:** Server requests the Client (Host/AI) to perform a "sampling" operation (e.g., generate text based on context provided by the server).
4.  **Session Termination:**
    - Client or Server initiates session termination.

This deep dive should provide a solid understanding of the moving parts within the MCP architecture and how they interact.
