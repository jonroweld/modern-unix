# WebCodecs

WebCodecs is a low-level API that provides direct access to media encoding and decoding capabilities in web browsers. It enables high-performance processing of audio and video streams for real-time and multi-modal applications.

## Working with Media Codecs in Python: PyAV

- [`PyAV`](https://pyav.org/) is the most popular Python library for working with audio and video codecs, built on top of FFmpeg.

### Installation

```bash
pip install av
```

### Example: Basic Video Decoding and Encoding

#### 1. Decode a Video File

```python
import av

container = av.open('input.mp4')
for frame in container.decode(video=0):
    print(f"Frame: {frame.index}, PTS: {frame.pts}")
```

#### 2. Encode Video Frames to a New File

```python
import av
import numpy as np

output = av.open('output.mp4', mode='w')
stream = output.add_stream('mpeg4', rate=24)
stream.width = 640
stream.height = 480
stream.pix_fmt = 'yuv420p'

for i in range(24):
    img = np.random.randint(0, 255, (480, 640, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    frame = av.VideoFrame.from_ndarray(img, format='rgb24')
    packet = stream.encode(frame)
    if packet:
        output.mux(packet)
output.close()
```

## Conceptual Overview

### What is WebCodecs?

WebCodecs is a browser API for low-level access to media encoders and decoders, enabling efficient, real-time processing of audio and video streams. In Python, similar functionality is provided by libraries like PyAV (FFmpeg bindings).

### Key Characteristics

- **Low-Level Access:** Direct control over encoding/decoding.
- **Performance:** Minimal overhead, suitable for real-time applications.
- **Flexibility:** Supports a wide range of codecs and formats.

### Strengths

- **Efficiency:** High-performance media processing.
- **Versatility:** Works with many codecs and containers.
- **Real-Time:** Suitable for streaming, conferencing, and AI applications.

### Weaknesses

- **Complexity:** Requires understanding of codecs and media formats.
- **Platform Differences:** Browser and Python APIs differ in details.

### Use Cases in Agentic and Multi-Modal AI Systems

- **Real-Time Video/Audio:** Streaming, conferencing, and surveillance.
- **AI Processing:** Preprocessing media for ML models.
- **Transcoding:** Converting between formats for interoperability.

### Place in the Protocol Stack

- **Layer:** Application Layer (media processing)
- **Above:** WebRTC, streaming protocols
- **Below:** File systems, network transport
