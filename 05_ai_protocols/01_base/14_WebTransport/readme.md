# WebTransport

WebTransport is a modern protocol for low-latency, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers, built on top of HTTP/3 and QUIC. It is designed for real-time applications that require reliable and efficient data transfer.

## Working with WebTransport in Python: aioquic

- [`aioquic`](https://github.com/aiortc/aioquic) is the leading Python library for QUIC, HTTP/3, and WebTransport.

### Installation

```bash
pip install aioquic
```

### Example: WebTransport Server & Client

> Note: WebTransport is a new protocol and browser support is still emerging. The following is a minimal example using aioquic. For full examples, see the aioquic [examples directory](https://github.com/aiortc/aioquic/tree/main/examples).

#### 1. Server (webtransport_server.py):

```python
from aioquic.asyncio import serve
from aioquic.quic.configuration import QuicConfiguration
import asyncio

async def webtransport_handler(stream_id, stream_reader, stream_writer):
    print(f"New stream: {stream_id}")
    while True:
        data = await stream_reader.read(1024)
        if not data:
            break
        print(f"Received: {data.decode()}")
        stream_writer.write(data)  # Echo back
        await stream_writer.drain()
    stream_writer.close()

async def main():
    configuration = QuicConfiguration(is_client=False)
    await serve(
        "0.0.0.0",
        4433,
        configuration=configuration,
        stream_handler=webtransport_handler
    )

# asyncio.run(main())
```

#### 2. Client (webtransport_client.py):

```python
from aioquic.asyncio import connect
from aioquic.quic.configuration import QuicConfiguration
import asyncio

async def main():
    configuration = QuicConfiguration(is_client=True)
    async with connect("localhost", 4433, configuration=configuration) as protocol:
        stream_id = protocol._quic.get_next_available_stream_id()
        protocol._quic.send_stream_data(stream_id, b"Hello, WebTransport!", end_stream=True)
        await protocol.wait_closed()

# asyncio.run(main())
```

## Conceptual Overview

### What is WebTransport?

WebTransport is a web API and protocol for low-latency, bidirectional, client-server communication over HTTP/3 (QUIC). It is designed for real-time, interactive, and streaming applications.

### Key Characteristics

- **HTTP/3/QUIC-Based:** Runs over HTTP/3, leveraging QUIC's features.
- **Bidirectional Streams:** Supports multiple, independent streams per connection.
- **Low Latency:** Designed for real-time and interactive use cases.
- **Secure:** Always encrypted (TLS 1.3).

### Strengths

- **Performance:** Low-latency, high-throughput communication.
- **Modern Web:** Designed for next-gen web apps and games.
- **Multiplexing:** Multiple streams, no head-of-line blocking.

### Weaknesses

- **Browser Support:** Still emerging; not all browsers support it yet.
- **Complexity:** Requires HTTP/3/QUIC infrastructure.

### Use Cases in Agentic and Multi-Modal AI Systems

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Live data, chat, and control.
- **Streaming:** Video, audio, and telemetry.
- **Gaming:** Multiplayer, low-latency game state sync.

### Place in the Protocol Stack

- **Layer:** Application Layer (OSI Layer 7, over HTTP/3)
- **Above:** Web apps, real-time services
- **Below:** HTTP/3, QUIC
