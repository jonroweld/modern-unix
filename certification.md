### Advanced Modern AI Python Level 2 (Professional) Quiz

Total Questions: 50

Duration: 2 hours 30 minutes

The "Advanced Modern AI Python Level 2 (Professional) Quiz" is a well-structured assessment comprising 50 questions, designed to evaluate advanced proficiency in Python programming with a focus on modern features and best practices. The quiz content, as provided in the document, is consistent across its 50 questions, covering a range of topics such as static typing, abstract base classes (ABCs), protocols, asynchronous programming with asyncio, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and modern libraries like Pydantic v2 and dataclasses.

**Overall level**: Advanced (upper-intermediate to professional)
Learners must be fluent in modern static typing, generics, variance, Pydantic v2, asyncio, multiple-inheritance MRO, and protocol-based design—topics usually taught in senior-level or graduate courses.

**Preparation Guidance for Students**

To prepare for the Advanced Modern AI Python Level 2 (Professional) Quiz, focus on mastering the following key topics to ensure success in this challenging assessment. Deepen your understanding of advanced static typing using mypy and pyright, including type hints, generics, variance (covariance, invariance), and structural subtyping with the typing.Protocol module. Study asynchronous programming with asyncio, covering coroutines, event loops, and concurrency patterns like asyncio.gather and asyncio.wait_for, emphasizing their application in I/O-bound tasks. Strengthen your knowledge of object-oriented programming principles, including multiple inheritance, method resolution order (MRO), abstract base classes (ABCs), and the differences between composition and aggregation. Familiarize yourself with modern Python libraries such as Pydantic v2 for data validation and dataclasses for streamlined class definitions. Additionally, review Python’s core features like duck typing, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), *args/**kwargs, and the behavior of .pyc files. Practice with resources like the mypy documentation (cheat sheets and protocols) and Colabs 12-17 from the provided GitHub repository (https://github.com/panaversity/learn-modern-ai-python). By honing these skills through code analysis and hands-on practice, you’ll be well-equipped to tackle the quiz’s complex scenarios with confidence.

To excel in this quiz, students should focus on mastering the following topics:

- **Advanced Static Typing with Mypy**: This includes a deep understanding of type hints, generics, and variance (invariance, covariance).
- **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) and typing.Protocol**: Students should be proficient in using these for structural subtyping and ensuring interface conformance.
- **Asynchronous Programming with asyncio**: This encompasses coroutines, event loops, and concurrency patterns such as asyncio.gather.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles**: A strong grasp of multiple inheritance, Method Resolution Order (MRO), composition vs. aggregation, and duck typing is crucial.
- **Modern Python Libraries**: This includes Pydantic v2 for data validation and dataclasses for streamlined class definitions.
- **CPython's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: Understanding its implications for concurrency is also essential

Familiarity with the mypy documentation (especially cheat sheets and protocols) and practical experience with relevant Colabs (12-17 from the recommended GitHub repository) will be highly beneficial for preparing for the challenging scenarios presented in the quiz.

### Fundamentals of Agentic AI Level 2 (Professional) Quiz

Total Questions: 48

Duration: 120 Minutes

Difficulty Level: Advanced (NOT beginner-level)

This is a well-constructed, comprehensive quiz that accurately tests deep knowledge of the OpenAI Agents SDK. However, it's significantly more challenging than typical beginner-level assessments.

**Difficulty Level for Beginners**

The quiz is challenging for beginners due to the following factors:

- **Technical Depth**: Questions require understanding the OpenAI Agents SDK’s architecture (e.g., Agents, Tools, Handoffs, Runner), Pydantic models, async programming, and prompt engineering. These are advanced topics for someone new to AI or Python.
- **Conceptual Complexity**: Topics like dynamic instructions, context management, error handling, and Chain-of-Thought prompting require familiarity with both theoretical and practical aspects of agentic AI.
- **Code Analysis**: Many questions involve analyzing code snippets, understanding execution paths, and predicting outcomes, which demand strong Python and debugging skills.
Domain Knowledge: Questions on Markdown are simpler, but the majority focus on niche SDK features, making the quiz specialized.
- **Beginner Challenges**: Beginners (e.g., those with basic Python knowledge and minimal AI experience) would struggle with SDK-specific concepts like Runner.run_sync, tool_choice, and Pydantic validation, as well as async programming and multi-agent workflows.

**Difficulty Rating**: Advanced (not beginner-friendly). Beginners would need foundational knowledge in Python, async programming, and LLMs, plus specific training on the OpenAI Agents SDK to perform well.

To excel in this quiz, focus on understanding the core components and philosophy of the OpenAI Agents SDK, such as its "Python-first" design for orchestration, the roles of Agents and Tools, and how primitives like "Handoffs" facilitate multi-agent collaboration. Pay close attention to how the SDK manages the agent loop, handles tool calls and Pydantic models for typed inputs/outputs, and uses context objects. Review concepts like dynamic instructions, agent cloning, error handling during tool execution, and the nuances of Runner.run_sync() versus streaming. Additionally, refresh your knowledge of prompt engineering techniques, including crafting clear instructions, guiding the agent's reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought), and managing sensitive data through persona and careful prompting. Finally, ensure you're comfortable with basic Markdown syntax for links and images.


**Preparation Guide for Beginner Students**

This OpenAI Agents SDK quiz is designed for intermediate to advanced learners and requires substantial preparation to succeed. Before attempting this assessment, ensure you have a solid foundation in Python programming, including object-oriented concepts, async/await patterns, decorators, and error handling. You'll need to thoroughly study Pydantic models for data validation, understanding field definitions, default values, and validation behavior. Dedicate significant time to the OpenAI Agents SDK documentation (https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/), focusing on core concepts like Agents, Tools, Handoffs, context management, and the agent execution loop. Practice writing and analyzing code that uses the @function_tool decorator, Runner.run_sync(), agent cloning, and multi-agent orchestration patterns. Review prompt engineering techniques from the OpenAI cookbook, particularly Chain-of-Thought prompting, system message design, and handling sensitive data. Finally, familiarize yourself with basic Markdown syntax for links and images. Plan to spend at least 2-3 weeks studying these materials, complete hands-on coding exercises with the SDK. Consider this quiz a capstone assessment that requires comprehensive understanding rather than a beginner-level introduction to the concepts.
