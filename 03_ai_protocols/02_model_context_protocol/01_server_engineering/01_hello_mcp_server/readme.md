# 01: Hello, MCP Server!

**Objective:** Get your first, very basic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server running using the `FastMCP` library.

This initial step focuses on the bare essentials:
1.  Creating a server.
2.  Defining a single, simple tool.
3.  Making the server accessible over HTTP.
4.  Interacting with it using a basic client.

This serves as the "Hello, World!" for MCP development, establishing a foundation for all subsequent lessons.

## Key MCP Concepts

-   **`FastMCP` Server:** A Python library that handles the low-level details of the MCP `2025-06-18` specification, allowing you to focus on application logic.
-   **Stateless HTTP Transport:** For simplicity, our initial examples will use a stateless HTTP model. The server processes each request independently without retaining memory of previous interactions.
-   **`@mcp.tool()` Decorator:** The primary mechanism in `FastMCP` for exposing a Python function as a tool that AI agents can discover and call.
-   **`tools/list`:** The standard MCP method a client uses to ask a server, "What can you do?". The server responds with a list of all functions decorated with `@mcp.tool()`.
-   **`tools/call`:** The standard MCP method a client uses to execute a specific tool by name, providing the necessary arguments.

## Implementation Plan

Inside the `hello-mcp/` subdirectory, we will:

-   **`server.py`:**
    -   Instantiate a `FastMCP` server.
    -   Define a simple function like `get_forecast(city: str)` and expose it as a tool using the `@mcp.tool()` decorator.
    -   Expose the server as a runnable ASGI application for `uvicorn`.

-   **`client.py`:**
    -   A simple Python script that uses `httpx` to make JSON-RPC requests.
    -   It will first call `tools/list` to discover the `get_forecast` tool.
    -   It will then call `tools/call` to execute the tool with a sample city and print the result.

-   **Postman Collection:**
    -   The `postman/` directory contains a collection to demonstrate how to interact with the server visually, which is excellent for learning the raw protocol.

## Key Concepts

- **`FastMCP`:** A Python library designed to simplify the creation of MCP-compliant servers. It handles much of the underlying MCP protocol complexities, allowing you to focus on defining your server's capabilities.
- **Server Instantiation:** Creating an instance of the `FastMCP` application.
- **Server Metadata:** Providing basic information about your server (like its name and version) that it will share with clients during initialization.

## Steps

1.  **Setup:**

    - Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.12+ recommended)and uv.

    ```bash
    uv init hello-mcp
    cd hello-mcp
    ```

2.  **Installation:**

    - Install the necessary packages using `uv`:

      ```bash

      uv add mcp uvicorn
      ```

3.  Update (`main.py`):

    - We will import `FastMCP` and create a simple tool with stateless http protocol

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Initialize FastMCP server
mcp = FastMCP("weather", stateless_http=True)


@mcp.tool()  # Using this mcp instance
async def get_forecast(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather forecast for a city.

    Args:
        city(str): The name of the city
    """
    return f"The weather in {city} will be warm and sunny"

mcp_stateless = mcp.streamable_http_app()
```

4.  **Run the Server:**

    - Execute the command:

      ```bash
      uv run uvicorn server:mcp_stateless --port 8000 --reload
      ```

    - This will start:
      - MCP server at: http://localhost:8000
      

5.  **Test the MCP Server:**
    
    **Option 1: Python Client (Programmatic)**
    ```bash
    uv run python client.py
    ```

    **Option 2: Postman (Visual & Educational) - RECOMMENDED FOR LEARNING**
    1. Install Postman from [postman.com](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
    2. Import the collection: `postman/Hello_MCP_Server.postman_collection.json`
    3. Run requests in sequence to understand MCP protocol
    4. See detailed documentation in `postman/README.md`

    **Option 3: MCP Inspector (Interactive)**
    ```bash
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
    ```
    - Run and Open MCP Inspector at: http://127.0.0.1:6274
    - Select Tools Tab and list and run the tool

## ðŸŽ“ Why Use Postman for Learning?

**Postman provides the best educational experience** because it:
- **Visualizes the Protocol**: See raw JSON-RPC requests and responses
- **Hands-on Learning**: Modify parameters and experiment easily
- **Better Debugging**: Clear error messages and response inspection
- **No Coding Required**: Focus on understanding MCP without Python complexity
- **Shareable**: Export collections to share with classmates/students

**Learning Path**:
1. Start with Postman to understand the protocol
2. Move to Python client to see programmatic usage
3. Use MCP Inspector for debugging later and testing

This "Hello, MCP Server!" example lays the groundwork. In subsequent sections, we'll build upon this to add tools, resources, and prompt templates, making our server progressively more useful to AI agents.

## ðŸ”— Next Steps

- **02_adding_resources**: Learn to provide contextual data to AI agents
- **03_prompt_templates**: Create reusable prompt templates
- **04_error_handling**: Handle errors gracefully
- **05_server_initialization**: Deep dive into MCP connection lifecycle and initialization handshake
