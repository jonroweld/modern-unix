# 05: MCP Server Connection Lifecycle Implementation üöÄ

**What you'll learn:** How to properly implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) connection lifecycle according to the [official specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/lifecycle).

The Model Context Protocol defines a **rigorous lifecycle** for client-server connections that ensures proper capability negotiation and state management. This implementation demonstrates the complete lifecycle phases with working code examples.

## üéØ What We're Building

A complete MCP connection lifecycle implementation that demonstrates:

1. **üöÄ Initialization Phase** - Capability negotiation and protocol version agreement
2. **‚öôÔ∏è Operation Phase** - Normal protocol communication  
3. **üõë Shutdown Phase** - Graceful termination of the connection

This follows the **official MCP 2025-03-26 specification** exactly, ensuring compatibility with all MCP-compliant systems.

## üìã The Three Phases of MCP Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Initialization üöÄ

The initialization phase **MUST** be the first interaction between client and server. During this phase:

- Protocol version compatibility is established
- Capabilities are exchanged and negotiated
- Implementation details are shared

#### Step 1: Initialize Request
The **client** initiates with an `initialize` request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-03-26",
    "capabilities": {
      "experimental": {},
      "sampling": {}
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "test-client",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Requirements:**
- The initialize request **MUST NOT** be part of a JSON-RPC batch
- No other requests are possible until initialization completes
- Client **SHOULD NOT** send requests (except pings) before server responds

#### Step 2: Initialize Response
The **server** responds with its capabilities:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-03-26",
    "capabilities": {
      "tools": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "logging": {},
      "prompts": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "resources": {
        "subscribe": true,
        "listChanged": true
      }
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "weather-server",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Initialized Notification
The **client** sends an `initialized` notification to confirm readiness:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/initialized"
}
```

**Important:** Server **SHOULD NOT** send requests (except pings and logging) before receiving this notification.

### Phase 2: Operation ‚öôÔ∏è

During the operation phase, client and server exchange messages according to negotiated capabilities:

- Both parties **MUST** respect the negotiated protocol version
- Only capabilities that were successfully negotiated **SHOULD** be used
- Normal MCP operations (tools, resources, prompts) are now available

### Phase 3: Shutdown üõë

**Per the MCP Specification**: *"No specific shutdown messages are defined‚Äîinstead, the underlying transport mechanism should be used to signal connection termination"*

Clean termination of the protocol connection using the underlying transport mechanism:

- **stdio**: Client closes input stream, waits for server exit, sends SIGTERM/SIGKILL if needed  
- **HTTP**: Shutdown indicated by closing HTTP connection(s) - **no JSON-RPC messages needed**

This is **spec-compliant behavior** - the transport layer handles termination, not the protocol layer.

## üîß Version Negotiation

### Protocol Version Handling
- Client **MUST** send a supported protocol version (preferably latest: `2025-03-26`)
- Server responds with same version (if supported) or different supported version
- If client doesn't support server's version, it **SHOULD** disconnect

### Version Compatibility
- **`2025-03-26`** - Latest specification with full feature support ‚úÖ
- **`2024-11-05`** - Previous version with limited features
- **`draft`** - Development version (not for production)

## üõ†Ô∏è Capability Negotiation

### Client Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Implementation |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| `roots` | Filesystem root access | `{ "listChanged": true }` |
| `sampling` | LLM sampling requests | `{}` |
| `experimental` | Non-standard features | `{}` |

### Server Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Implementation |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| `tools` | Callable functions | `{ "listChanged": true }` |
| `resources` | Readable resources | `{ "subscribe": true, "listChanged": true }` |
| `prompts` | Template prompts | `{ "listChanged": true }` |
| `logging` | Structured logs | `{}` |
| `completions` | Autocompletion | `{}` |
| `experimental` | Non-standard features | `{}` |

**Sub-capabilities:**
- `listChanged`: Support for list change notifications
- `subscribe`: Support for individual item change subscriptions (resources only)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Error Cases
- Protocol version mismatch
- Failed capability negotiation  
- Request timeouts
- Invalid initialization parameters

### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Unsupported protocol version",
    "data": {
      "supported": ["2025-03-26", "2024-11-05"],
      "requested": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeouts and Reliability

### Timeout Management
- Implementations **SHOULD** establish timeouts for all requests
- Timeout prevents hung connections and resource exhaustion
- SDKs **SHOULD** allow per-request timeout configuration
- Progress notifications **MAY** reset timeout clock
- Maximum timeout **SHOULD** always be enforced

### Best Practices
- Configure reasonable timeouts (30-120 seconds typical)
- Handle timeout gracefully with cancellation notifications
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Log timeout events for debugging

## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### Test 1: Complete Lifecycle
```bash
cd hello-mcp

# Terminal 1: Start MCP server
uv run server.py

# Terminal 2: Test complete lifecycle  
uv run client.py
```

**Expected Flow:**
1. ‚úÖ Initialize request sent with protocol version `2025-03-26`
2. ‚úÖ Server responds with capabilities (tools, logging, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Initialized notification confirms readiness
4. ‚úÖ Tools list retrieved successfully
5. ‚úÖ Weather tool called and responds correctly
6. ‚úÖ Connection closes gracefully (no termination message needed)

### Test 2: Postman API Testing
```bash
cd postman/
# Import MCP lifecycle test collection
# Run complete lifecycle test suite
```

## üö® Common Implementation Mistakes

### ‚ùå Wrong: Skipping Initialization Steps
```python
# Don't do this - missing initialized notification
response = await client.post(url, json=initialize_request)
# Immediately calling tools without initialized notification
```

### ‚úÖ Right: Complete Lifecycle
```python
# 1. Initialize
response = await client.post(url, json=initialize_request)
# 2. Send initialized notification  
await client.post(url, json=initialized_notification)
# 3. Now tools are available
```

### ‚ùå Wrong: Incorrect Version Handling
```python
# Don't hardcode old versions
"protocolVersion": "2024-11-05"  # Outdated
```

### ‚úÖ Right: Use Latest Version
```python
"protocolVersion": "2025-03-26"  # Current specification
```

### ‚ùå Wrong: Ignoring Capabilities
```python
# Don't assume server has capabilities
await call_tool("nonexistent_tool")
```

### ‚úÖ Right: Check Negotiated Capabilities
```python
# First check what tools are available
tools_response = await client.post(url, json=list_tools_request)
# Then call only available tools
```

### ‚ùå Wrong: Sending Unnecessary Shutdown Messages
```python
# Don't send termination notifications - not required by spec
await client.post(url, json={"method": "notifications/terminated"})
```

### ‚úÖ Right: Spec-Compliant Shutdown
```python
# Per MCP spec: "No specific shutdown messages are defined"
# For HTTP: shutdown indicated by closing connection
async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    # ... MCP operations ...
    pass  # Connection closes automatically - that's it!
```

## üéì What You've Learned

‚úÖ **MCP Lifecycle Phases** - Initialization, Operation, Shutdown  
‚úÖ **Version Negotiation** - Protocol compatibility handling  
‚úÖ **Capability Exchange** - Client/server feature negotiation  
‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Proper error responses and timeouts  
‚úÖ **Transport Details** - HTTP/SSE implementation specifics  
‚úÖ **Session Management** - Maintaining connection state  

## üöÄ Next Steps

Now that you understand MCP connection lifecycle:
