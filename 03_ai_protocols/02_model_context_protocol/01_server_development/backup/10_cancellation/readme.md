# 🛑 MCP Request Cancellation

## 📋 Overview

This module demonstrates **request cancellation** in the Model Context Protocol (MCP). When AI agents need to handle long-running tasks, they must support graceful cancellation to remain responsive and resource-efficient.

## ❓ The Problem

Without cancellation support:
- 🐌 Long-running tasks block the system
- 💸 Resources are wasted on unwanted operations  
- 😤 Users can't interrupt incorrect or unnecessary tasks
- 🔥 Systems become unresponsive

## ✨ The Solution

MCP cancellation provides:
- ⏹️ **Graceful termination** of long-running tasks
- 🧹 **Resource cleanup** when tasks are cancelled
- 🏁 **Race condition handling** for immediate cancellations
- 📊 **Task lifecycle management** for better UX

## 🔄 Core Flow

```
1. 🚀 Start long-running task
   └── Get request/task ID for tracking

2. 📋 Track active tasks
   └── Store task references for cancellation

3. ⏹️ Cancel task (when needed)
   └── Send cancellation signal

4. 🧹 Clean up resources
   └── Remove from tracking, free memory
```

## 🎯 Learning Paths

### 🟢 Beginner
- Run `simple_demo.py` to see concepts in action
- Understand task lifecycle and cancellation points
- Learn about asyncio task management

### 🟡 Intermediate  
- Study the FastMCP server implementation
- Explore tool-based cancellation approach
- Test with httpx client examples

### 🔴 Advanced
- Implement proper MCP notification handling
- Add per-session task tracking
- Build production-ready cancellation systems

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run the Concept Demo
```bash
# See all cancellation concepts in action
uv run simple_demo.py
```

This comprehensive demo shows:
- ✅ Basic cancellation flow
- ✅ Race condition handling  
- ✅ Multiple concurrent tasks
- ✅ Resource cleanup

### Run the MCP Server (Optional)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
uv run server.py

# Terminal 2: Test client
uv run httpx_client.py quick
```

## 📁 Files Overview

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `simple_demo.py` | 🎭 **Complete concept demo** (recommended) |
| `server.py` | 🖥️ FastMCP server with cancellation tools |
| `httpx_client.py` | 🔌 Simple HTTP client for testing |
| `client.py` | 📡 Full MCP protocol client |
| `postman/` | 🧪 API testing collection |

## 🎭 Demo Output

The `simple_demo.py` shows three scenarios:

### 1. Basic Cancellation
```
🚀 Starting long-running task...
📊 Processing dataset.csv... 1/8 seconds
📊 Processing dataset.csv... 2/8 seconds  
⏹️ Cancelling task...
✅ Successfully cancelled task
❌ Processing was cancelled
```

### 2. Race Condition
```
🏁 Testing race condition...
⚠️ Task not found (may have already completed)
⚡ Quick response: This completes immediately
```

### 3. Multiple Tasks
```
🚀 Starting 3 concurrent tasks...
⏹️ Cancelling middle task...
📊 Final results:
  Task 0: ✅ Successfully processed
  Task 1: ❌ Processing was cancelled  
  Task 2: ✅ Successfully processed
```

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

### 📊 Data Processing
- Cancel expensive database queries
- Stop large file processing operations
- Interrupt model training/inference

### 🤖 AI Agents  
- Stop reasoning chains that take too long
- Cancel tool executions that are no longer needed
- Interrupt multi-step workflows

### 🌐 Web Services
- Handle user navigation away from pages
- Cancel API requests when clients disconnect  
- Stop batch operations when priorities change

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Task Tracking
```python
# Global task registry
active_tasks: Dict[str, asyncio.Task] = {}

# Register task for cancellation
current_task = asyncio.current_task()
active_tasks[task_id] = current_task
```

### Cancellation Points
```python
# Check for cancellation during processing
for i in range(processing_time):
    if task_id in active_tasks:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Cancellation point
    else:
        return "Task was cancelled"
```

### Resource Cleanup
```python
try:
    # Do work...
except asyncio.CancelledError:
    # Clean up resources
    if task_id in active_tasks:
        del active_tasks[task_id]
    return "Task cancelled"
```

## 📚 MCP Specification

This implementation follows the [MCP Cancellation Specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/server/cancellation/).

Key points:
- ⚡ Cancellation should be **fast** (< 1 second)
- 🧹 Resources must be **cleaned up** properly
- 🏁 **Race conditions** must be handled gracefully
- 📊 Task **status tracking** should be accurate

## 🎉 Success Criteria

After running the demos, you should understand:

✅ **How to track long-running tasks**  
✅ **When and how to cancel operations**  
✅ **How to handle race conditions**  
✅ **How to clean up resources properly**  
✅ **How to build responsive AI agents**

## 🔗 Next Steps

- 📖 Study MCP notifications for proper protocol handling
- 🏗️ Build production cancellation systems
- 🔧 Integrate with your AI agent framework
- 📊 Add metrics and monitoring for task lifecycle

💡 **Key Insight**: Cancellation isn't just about stopping tasks—it's about building **responsive, resource-efficient AI agents** that users can trust and control.
