# 🔄 MCP Resumption - Postman Testing Guide

## 🎯 **What This Tests**

**Core concept**: Initialize → Tool call times out → Resume & retry with Last-Event-ID

This simplified Postman collection demonstrates MCP resumption in just 4 clear steps.

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **1. Start the Server**
```bash
cd 06_resumption
python server.py
# Server has 6-second delays to cause timeouts
```

### **2. Import Collection**
```bash
# In Postman: Import > Upload Files
# Select: MCP_Resumption_Tests.postman_collection.json
```

### **3. Run Tests in Order**
Follow the **numbered sequence** - each test builds on the previous one!

## 📊 **Test Flow - Simple 4 Steps**

### **🧪 STEP 1: Initialize MCP Connection**
1. **Initialize MCP Server** - Get session ID and event ID
2. **Send Initialized Notification** - Complete handshake  

### **🧪 STEP 2: Tool Call Timeout (Connection Drop)**
3. **Tool Call with Timeout** - 2s timeout vs 6s server delay = guaranteed timeout!

### **🧪 STEP 3: Resume & Retry Tool Call**
4. **Resume & Retry Tool Call** - Same tool call but with `Last-Event-ID` header

## 🔍 **What You'll See**

### **✅ Success Pattern**
- Tests 1-2: MCP initialized ✅
- Test 3: Times out as expected ⏰ (this proves connection broke!)
- Test 4: Tool call succeeds with resumption ✅

### **📊 Console Output**
```
✅ Session ID captured: sess_abc123
📋 Event ID captured: 1001
💥 Connection timed out as expected - simulating network drop
🔄 Ready for resumption in next test...
📋 Resumed from Event ID: 1001
✅ RESUMPTION SUCCESSFUL! Tool call worked after timeout
🌤️ Weather result: The weather in New York will be warm and sunny!
🎯 MCP Resumption Demo Complete!
💡 Key insight: Connection broke → Resumed with Last-Event-ID → Success!
```

## 🔧 **Key Features**

### **Automatic Event ID Tracking**
The collection automatically extracts and stores event IDs:
```javascript
// Finds "id: 12345" in SSE response
if (line.startsWith('id: ')) {
    eventId = line.substring(4).trim();
    pm.collectionVariables.set('last_event_id', eventId);
}
```

### **Session Management**
Auto-captures session IDs:
```javascript
const sessionId = pm.response.headers.get('mcp-session-id');
pm.collectionVariables.set('mcp_session_id', sessionId);
```

### **The Magic Resumption Header**
Test 4 includes the key header that makes resumption work:
```json
{
  "key": "Last-Event-ID",
  "value": "{{last_event_id}}",
  "description": "This is the magic header that enables resumption!"
}
```

## 🎓 **Learning Outcomes**

After running these tests, you'll understand:

- ✅ How MCP initialization establishes connections
- ✅ Why timeouts happen (network problems are real!)
- ✅ How `Last-Event-ID` enables resumption
- ✅ How the same tool call succeeds after resumption
- ✅ The power of never losing progress

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **Server Not Running**
   ```bash
   python server.py  # Start server first
   ```

2. **Test 3 Doesn't Timeout**
   - Check timeout is set to 2000ms (2 seconds)
   - Server delay is 6 seconds, so should definitely timeout
   - Look for "Connection timed out as expected" message

3. **Event IDs Not Tracking**
   - Check Test Results tab for console logs
   - Look for "Event ID captured" messages

4. **Test 4 Fails**
   - Ensure Tests 1-3 completed successfully first
   - Check `Last-Event-ID` header is present in Test 4
   - Verify the event ID variable was captured in Test 1

## 🔍 **How to Prove Real Resumption (Not Cached Response)**

The ultimate test to confirm resumption is REAL:

### **Method 1: Change Server Response**
1. Run tests 1-3 (initialize → timeout)
2. **Stop the server** (Ctrl+C)
3. **Edit server.py** - change the weather response text
4. **Restart server** 
5. Run test 4 (resume with Last-Event-ID)
6. **Verify you get the NEW response** 

If you get the modified response, it proves the server processed the request fresh, not from cache!

### **Method 2: Use the Proof Script**
Run the automated proof test:
```bash
python test_resumption_proof.py
```

This script automatically:
- Makes a call that times out
- Stops server & modifies response  
- Restarts server
- Resumes with Last-Event-ID
- Confirms you get the NEW response

### **What This Proves**
- ✅ **Real Resumption**: Server processes request fresh
- ✅ **Not Cached**: Response changes prove live processing
- ✅ **State Persistence**: Last-Event-ID maintains session context
- ✅ **MCP Spec Compliance**: Proper resumption behavior

## 💡 **The Big Picture**

This simplified collection proves that:
- **Network problems happen** (Test 3 timeout)
- **Resumption works** (Test 4 succeeds)
- **No work is lost** (Same tool call, different outcome)
- **Last-Event-ID is the key** (The magic header that makes it work)

## 🎯 **Test Sequence Summary**

| Test | Purpose | Expected Result |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Initialize | ✅ Get session & event ID |
| 2 | Complete handshake | ✅ Connection established |
| 3 | Tool call (timeout) | ⏰ Times out (good!) |
| 4 | Resume & retry | ✅ Succeeds with Last-Event-ID |

Perfect for understanding **MCP Stream Resumption** fundamentals! 🚀
