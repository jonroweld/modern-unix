[Course: Long-Term Agentic Memory with LangGraph](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/long-term-agentic-memory-with-langgraph/)

Note: We want to use this course to learn concept which we will use to implement the LangMem Core API to integrate with the OpenAI Agents SDK


[Official Docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langmem/)

Key features

üß© **[Core memory API](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langmem/concepts/conceptual_guide/#functional-core)** that works with any storage system and any Agentic Framework, we will work with these API
üß† Memory management tools that agents can use to record and search information during active conversations "in the hot path"
‚öôÔ∏è Background memory manager that automatically extracts, consolidates, and updates agent knowledge
‚ö° Native integration with LangGraph's Long-term Memory Store, available by default in all LangGraph Platform deployments, at this stage we are not interested in these integrations.
