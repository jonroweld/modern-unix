## **Built-in Tools Available**
These tools empower AI agents with advanced functionalities directly through OpenAI's APIs:

### 1. **Web Search**
- **Functionality**: Perform real-time searches to gather current information directly from the web.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Retrieving up-to-date facts and news.
  - Sourcing real-time insights for decision-making.
  - Gathering timely content for dynamic responses.

### 2. **File Search**
- **Functionality**: Search and retrieve relevant information from uploaded documents and files.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Analyzing and summarizing large documents.
  - Extracting data from various file types.
  - Automating information retrieval from structured or unstructured documents.

### 3. **Computer Use**
- **Functionality**: Automate tasks directly on a computer or server.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Managing file operations and manipulations.
  - Executing code snippets and performing system tasks.
  - Automating software operations, scripting, and process management.

## **Integration with Agents SDK**
These built-in tools are fully integrated and easily accessible via the **Agents SDK**, a structured framework provided by OpenAI to help developers:

- **Orchestrate Complex Workflows**:
  - Easily coordinate multiple AI agents or actions in a coherent workflow.
  - Automate intricate, multi-step interactions seamlessly.

- **Coordinate Tool Usage**:
  - Agents autonomously choose appropriate built-in tools based on context or task.
  - Simplify complex scenarios by abstracting tool interactions.

- **Streamline Development**:
  - Abstract away lower-level API interactions, reducing complexity.
  - Build cleaner, more maintainable codebases for robust agent applications.

## **Typical Workflow Example**
Here's a simplified illustration of how an agent workflow may leverage these built-in tools through the Agents SDK:

```plaintext
AI Agent (via Agents SDK)
       â”‚
       â”œâ”€ Web Search â†’ Retrieve real-time data
       â”‚
       â”œâ”€ File Search â†’ Analyze internal documents
       â”‚
       â””â”€ Computer Use â†’ Execute automated tasks or scripts
```
