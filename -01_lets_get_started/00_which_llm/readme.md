# Which LLM Should You Use?

In today’s AI-driven world, a key question is: which large language model (LLM) should you choose? My method starts with consulting the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmarena-ai/chatbot-arena-leaderboard) from LMSYS, a trusted resource for evaluating LLMs based on their real-world conversational abilities. It relies on crowdsourced human votes and an Elo rating system, offering a lively, community-backed ranking. The top three LLMs shift as new versions emerge, but current trends suggest models like [OpenAI’s GPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Google’s Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app), and [xAI’s Grok](https://grok.com/) often lead the pack. These stand out for their sharp reasoning, smooth dialogue, and adaptability to various tasks.

Next, I dig into which LLM minimizes agenda-driven filtering—a tougher but crucial factor. By “filtering,” I mean things like censorship, skewed responses, or pushing a particular perspective, often shaped by the goals of the model’s creators. I tackle this by examining the philosophy behind each LLM’s development and any clues about how they perform in practice. I’m after a model that doesn’t shy away from hard questions or polish its answers too much. The best way to decide? Throw a bold, tricky prompt at them and see which one holds its ground.

That’s my approach. What do you think?

Here’s the paraphrased version with **context size** added as an additional criterion, woven into the analysis. Context size is critical for AI agents, as it determines how much information the LLM can process at once—especially for tasks requiring long conversations, extensive documents, or multi-step workflows.

Here’s the updated paraphrased version with **structured output** added as a fifth criterion alongside reasoning ability, tool-calling proficiency, accuracy, cost efficiency, and context size. Structured output is vital for AI agents that need to produce consistent, machine-readable responses (e.g., JSON, XML) for downstream processing or tool integration.
