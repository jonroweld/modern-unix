# Add Hot Reloading for Cloud-Native [Local Development (using Tilt)](https://docs.tilt.dev/index.html)

### Whatâ€™s Happening?

We have deployed the Dapr infrastructure (Control Plane, Dashboard, Redis, Components) in our Kubernetes cluster (Rancher Desktop) using Helm and `kubectl apply` (from Document 01). We have also set up our FastAPI project with the application code, Dockerfile, and Kubernetes manifests (from Document 02).

Now, we need an efficient way to develop our FastAPI application with rapid iteration and hot-reloading, while keeping the application running within Kubernetes alongside its Dapr sidecar and components. 

The standard cloud-native approach for this kind of rapid development loop in Kubernetes is to use a tool that watches your local filesystem and syncs code changes into the running container. We will use **Tilt** to achieve this. Tilt will automate building the development image, deploying your application to Kubernetes, and crucially, syncing your local code changes into the running pod to trigger FastAPI's hot-reloading (via Uvicorn's `--reload` flag) and tilt to sync local changes within kubernetes pod.

This setup aligns with the DACA principle of developing within a production-like (containerized, Kubernetes-based) environment from Stage 1.

Here we will configure it with fastapi and in next step learn to setup dapr sidecar as well.

### Prerequisites

*   You have completed all steps in Document 01 (Dapr Control Plane, Dashboard, Redis, Dapr Components deployed in Kubernetes).
*   You have completed Steps 1 and 2 in Document 02 (Project setup, `main.py`, `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `kubernetes/deployment.yaml`, `kubernetes/service.yaml` created).
*   Your Kubernetes cluster (Rancher Desktop) is running.
*   Ensure you are in the root directory of your `hello_fastapi` project.

### 1. Install Tilt

Tilt is a command-line tool and a local server with a UI. Install it on your local machine.

*   **macOS (Homebrew):**
    ```bash
    brew install tilt
    ```
*   **Windows (Chocolatey):**
    ```bash
    choco install tilt
    ```
*   **Linux:**
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://run.tilt.dev/install.sh | bash
    ```
*   **Other methods:** See the [official Tilt installation guide](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html).

Verify installation:
```bash
tilt version
```

### 2. Modify Dockerfile for Development

For hot-reloading to work inside the container using Uvicorn, the `CMD` instruction must include the `--reload` flag.

Open your `Dockerfile` (created in Document 02) and modify the `CMD` line:

```dockerfile
# ... other layers from Document 02 Dockerfile
EXPOSE 8000
# Original: CMD ["uv", "run", "uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
# Modified for Development Hot-reloading:
CMD ["uv", "run", "uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--reload"]
```

**Note:** This `Dockerfile` with `--reload` is optimized for your *development* workflow with Tilt. When you move to subsequent DACA deployment stages (prototyping, production), you will typically use a `Dockerfile` *without* the `--reload` flag for stability and performance in non-development environments. Tilt builds a *development image* based on this modified Dockerfile.

### 3. Create the Tiltfile

The `Tiltfile` tells Tilt how to build, deploy, and manage your application for development. Create a file named `Tiltfile` in the root of your `hello_dapr_fastapi` project directory.

Add the following content to `Tiltfile`:

```python
# Tiltfile for FastAPI Hot-reloading Development

# Load the nerdctl extension for Rancher Desktop
load('ext://nerdctl', 'nerdctl_build')

# Build the image using nerdctl, optimized for containerd and Kubernetes
nerdctl_build(
    ref='dapr-fastapi-hello',
    context='.',
    dockerfile='Dockerfile',
    live_update=[
        # Sync local directory '.' to '/code' in the container
        sync('.', '/code'),
        # Optional: Restart Uvicorn if reload fails
        # run('pkill -f uvicorn', trigger=['./main.py'])
    ]
)

# Deploy Kubernetes manifests (deployment and service).
# Assumes Dapr components (Redis, statestore, pubsub) are already deployed.
k8s_yaml(['kubernetes/deployment.yaml', 'kubernetes/service.yaml'])

# Define the Kubernetes resource for Tilt to manage.
# Includes port-forwarding to access the app at http://localhost:8000.
k8s_resource(
    'dapr-fastapi-hello',
    port_forwards='8000:8000',
    extra_pod_selectors={'app': 'dapr-fastapi-hello'}
)
```


### 4. Run Tilt

Now, start Tilt from your project root directory:

```bash
tilt up
```

Tilt will:
1.  Start its UI in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:10350`).
2.  Read your `Tiltfile`.
3.  Build your Docker image (or use a cached one).
4.  Deploy your Kubernetes manifests (`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`) to Rancher Desktop. This will create your app pod with the Dapr sidecar injected.
5.  Start watching your local filesystem for changes.
6.  Set up the port-forwarding.

Watch the Tilt UI. You should see your `fastapi-hello` resource, its logs (including the Dapr sidecar starting and your FastAPI app starting via Uvicorn), and the port-forwarding status. Wait until the resource is green (healthy).

### 5. Verify Hot Reloading

Now that Tilt is running and managing your application in Kubernetes:



### 6. Stop and Clean Up Tilt Development Session

When you are finished with your development session:

1.  Go back to the terminal where you ran `tilt up`.
2.  Press `Ctrl+C`. Tilt will stop the process.
3.  To remove the resources Tilt deployed to Kubernetes:
    ```bash
    tilt down
    ```
    This will delete the deployment and service that Tilt created.

This completes the setup for cloud-native local development with hot-reloading using Tilt, fitting into your DACA Stage 1 workflow. You can now iterate rapidly on your FastAPI application while it runs in the ta
