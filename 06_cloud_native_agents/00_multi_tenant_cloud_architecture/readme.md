# Architecting Scalable Multi-Tenant Agentic Workflows in the Cloud

Our platform for prototyping and enterprise scale Agentic AI solutions uses OpenAI Agents SDK, LangMem, MCP, Neon Serverless Postgres, Neo4j AuraDB, Chainlit, and Streamlit. 

This chapter discusses how to architect a agentic solutions for large scale global deployment. 

## The Requirements:

I am designing long-running, multi-tenant agentic workflows that need to scale efficiently in a cloud environment. I plan to use the OpenAI Agents SDK for agent development. My goal is to balance scalability, cost, and performance, but I’m facing challenges with state management and workflow execution. Specifically:

1. Statefulness vs. Scalability: Implementing stateful workflows (e.g., deploying a stateful container per tenant) ensures persistence but increases costs and limits scalability. Alternatively, using serverless containers requires fetching state from a database on each request, which introduces latency and raises costs due to frequent database calls. How can I optimize state management to minimize these trade-offs?

2. Long-Running Workflows in Serverless: Some workflows may need to run for minutes or longer. Serverless environments typically have execution time limits (e.g., 15 minutes on AWS Lambda). How can I architect a solution to support extended workflow execution in a serverless setup, or should I consider a hybrid approach?

3. Background Task Scheduling: I need to schedule and execute background tasks (e.g., delayed actions or periodic jobs) for each tenant. What’s the best way to handle this in a scalable, cost-effective manner within a cloud environment?

4. Event-Driven Triggers: I want containers to wake up or activate based on specific events (e.g., a message or tenant-specific trigger). How can I implement an event-driven architecture to achieve this efficiently, especially in a serverless context?

5. How do a do polling of external API's in a serverless container environment?

6. Architecture Options: One idea is to use an event-driven architecture with Kafka for event streaming and FastAPI in serverless containers for processing. Is this a viable approach, or are there better alternatives (e.g., using AWS Step Functions, Azure Durable Functions, or another framework) that address the above challenges?


Please provide practical recommendations, including architecture patterns, tools, or services, that balance scalability, cost, and performance for multi-tenant agentic workflows in the cloud. If possible, include trade-offs or considerations for each suggested solution.
