### Why OpenAI Agents SDK should be the main framework for agentic development for most use cases?

**Table 1: Comparison of Abstraction Levels in AI Agent Frameworks**

| **Framework**         | **Abstraction Level** | **Key Characteristics**                                                                 | **Learning Curve** | **Control Level** | **Simplicity** |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **OpenAI Agents SDK** | Minimal              | Python-first, core primitives (Agents, Handoffs, Guardrails), direct control           | Low               | High             | High           |
| **CrewAI**            | Moderate             | Role-based agents, crews, tasks, focus on collaboration                                | Low-Medium        | Medium           | Medium         |
| **AutoGen**           | High                 | Conversational agents, flexible conversation patterns, human-in-the-loop support       | Medium            | Medium           | Medium         |
| **Google ADK**        | Moderate             | Multi-agent hierarchies, Google Cloud integration (Gemini, Vertex AI), rich tool ecosystem, bidirectional streaming | Medium            | Medium-High      | Medium         |
| **LangGraph**         | Low-Moderate         | Graph-based workflows, nodes, edges, explicit state management                        | Very High         | Very High        | Low            |
| **Dapr Agents**       | Moderate             | Stateful virtual actors, event-driven multi-agent workflows, Kubernetes integration, 50+ data connectors, built-in resiliency | Medium            | Medium-High      | Medium         |


The table clearly identifies why OpenAI Agents SDK should be the main framework for agentic development for most use cases:
- It excels in **simplicity** and **ease of use**, making it the best choice for rapid development and broad accessibility.
- It offers **high control** with **minimal abstraction**, providing the flexibility needed for agentic development without the complexity of frameworks like LangGraph.
- It outperforms most alternatives (CrewAI, AutoGen, Google ADK, Dapr Agents) in balancing usability and power, and while LangGraph offers more control, its complexity makes it less practical for general use.

If your priority is ease of use, flexibility, and quick iteration in agentic development, OpenAI Agents SDK is the clear winner based on the table. However, if your project requires enterprise-scale features (e.g., Dapr Agents) or maximum control for complex workflows (e.g., LangGraph), you might consider those alternatives despite their added complexity. 

## Core Cloud Native Agentic Courses:

### AI-201:  Fundamentals of Agentic AI -  From Foundations to DACA Distributed Agents
Kickstart your journey into Agentic AI! This foundational course provides an intensive introduction to Agentic AI, a cutting-edge field focused on building autonomous, intelligent systems with memories, Agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and standards based MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool calling. In this course our main focus will be to use Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent (DACA) Design Pattern in the development stage locally. Students will first establish a strong understanding of the essential building blocks: Conversational and Generative AI. We will then rapidly progress into the exciting realm of prototyping Agentic AI systems using OpenAI Responses API and OpenAI Agents SDK, emphasizing practical application and hands-on skill development, including crucial aspects of Short and Long-Term Memories, Standardized Tools Calling (MCP), Agentic RAG, Prototype Deployment, and Observability.
